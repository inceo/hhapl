However, inactivation is not enough by itself to account fully for the repolarization. "

With the removal of the pulse, the activated channels are deactivated."

This observation indicates that the Na+ and K+ channels are unique; one of these can be selectively blocked and not affect the other. Another agent, tetraethylammonium (TEA), has no effect on the voltage-dependent changes in Na+ permeability, but it completely abolishes the voltage-dependent changes in K+ permeability. "

    "The __absolute refractory period__ is a period of time after the initiation of one action potential when it is impossible to initiate a second action potential no matter how much the cell is depolarized. The __relative refractory period__ is a period after one action potential is initiated when it is possible to initiate a second action potential, but only with a greater depolarization than was necessary to initiate the first. The relative refractory period can be understood at least in part by the hyperpolarizing afterpotential. Assume that an initial stimulus depolarized a cell from -60 mV to -45 mV in order to reach threshold and then consider delivering the same 15-mV stimulus sometime during the after-hyperpolarization. The stimulus would again depolarize the cell but the depolarization would be below threshold and insufficient to trigger an action potential. If the stimulus was made larger, however, such that it again was capable of depolarizing the cell to threshold (-45 mV), an action potential could be initiated. "
